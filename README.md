# MiniCalculator
I have made simple unit tests that tests this program's ability to handle simple math.

To unit test the multiplication I called the multiplication method with a zero because no matter what the total is at the time it will always become zero.

To unit test the division I divided 1 by 2 and in java it will always come out to round down to the nearest whole number, by dividing this by any number the result will be zero. I also made sure to put code into the divide method to prevent dividing by zero from occuring.

To unit test calculation I used methods multiple times with simple math to see if it could follow along, then I called the calculate method to see if it works. In my test I multiplied the 1 by 8 then by 2, after I divided by 4 and the answer should also be 4.
